## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Lessons 

- In summary, you will have three different authentication methods:
- Backend
- Cookie-based authentication for regular users. ✔️
- custom Token-based authentication for the superadmin role.❌
- JWT authentication for the admin and editor roles.❌
- Frontend
- Design Welcome page , Login, Registration and Payment System. ✔️
- Multi Role based Dashboard Same Template with role based Functionality ✔️

## Options

There are four properties for `Placeholder` images that you might want to customize, all of which are exposed to Interface Builder:

- `title` lets you add an optional string to be placed above the size, e.g. “User avatar”.
- `textColor` lets you adjust the text color used to render the title and size. Defaults to `.white`.
- `textFontSize` lets you adjust the text font size used to render the title and size. Defaults to `20`.
- `rounded` rounds the corners of the image view using the minimum of the width and height. This creates lozenges in rectangular views and circles in square views.
